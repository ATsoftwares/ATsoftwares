			<span class="text-20 text-left"> For many years, numerous individuals and business enterprises have been able
				to protect assets against factors such as unstable political and economic factors, business risks and personal
				circumstances and higher rates of taxation, just to name a few, through the use of international finance service
				(formerly called offshore) structures. For those of you seeking to plan your affairs to protect your wealth now and
				in the future, or if you desire to expand across international borders and wish to achieve financial efficiency,
				then you have come to the right firm. For over a decade, Wilfred Services Ltd. (Wilfred) has specialized in
				formulating tailor-made solutions for asset protection as well as wealth preservation and enhancement purposes.
				Wilfred even provides advice to clients in order to minimize and or defer their tax liabilities when conducting
				international transactions. Our firm also provides strategic and business advisory services to clients across the
				globe. We have an excellent, committed, reliable and competent staff with extensive experience in structuring
				clients affairs, whether it be registering a trusts and or corporate entity and assisting in the administration for
				either. We pride ourselves in building close working relationships with a wide range of professionals (i.e. lawyers,
				accountants, tax advisors) across many jurisdictions as we believe that our clients are better served with such a
				network to provide reliable and relevant advice. We also believe that to better understand and meet the individual
				needs of our clients in a professional and a responsive manner requires a knowledge base that only a broad network
